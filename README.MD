Welcome to my calculator app. 

Lots of credit to https://realpython.com/mobile-app-kivy-python/ which is where this app is based. 
The goal of this app was getting to learn Kivvy and starting to mess around with how to layout a GUI in this application.
So far I was able to replicate the tutorial and now I am starting to add some additional features to the application. 

Added features:
Parenthesis
Exponents
backspace button
