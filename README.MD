Welcome to my calculator app. 

Lots of credit to https://realpython.com/mobile-app-kivy-python/ which is where this app is based. 
The goal of this app was getting to learn Kivvy and starting to mess around with how to layout a GUI in this application.
So far I was able to replicate the tutorial and now I am starting to add some additional features to the application. 

Added features:
- Parenthesis
- Exponents
- backspace button

Current In progress:
- Square root

TODOs:
My early plans on this are still present in this. Need to separate out older artifacts into an old branch so I can reference if needed. As a note I currently
prefer the approach taken by the calculator as it handles things more organically and via natural python options. 

Roadmap
1. Clean up codebase separate legacy code into new branch. 
2. Continue adding base scientific calculator features.
3. Trig functions (sin, cos, tan, etc.)
4. logrhythms
5. Once basic scientific features can be used look into graphing capabilities.
